" Description: This is my personal Neovim configuration supporting Mac, Linux
" and Windows, with various plugins configured. This configuration evolves as
" I learn more about Nvim and becomes more proficient in using Nvim. Since it
" is very long (more than 1000 lines!), you should read it carefully and take
" only the settings and options that suits you. I would not recommend cloning
" this repo and replace your own config. Good configurations are personal,
" built over time with a lot of polish.
